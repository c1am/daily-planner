## User Story

```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```


## Functionality of Daily Planner

```
This web application allows you to keep track of your day from 9AM-5PM. Events can be input to each hour and saved to a local storage that automatically refreshes the page for you every hour - that way you are always on track! There is also a button to clear all events for fast refreshes and a button to save all events for fast changes too.

At the top of the page, there is a color-coded key to show the user if the time block happened in the past, is happening in the present, or will happen in the future.
```


## Demonstration of the Application
The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
